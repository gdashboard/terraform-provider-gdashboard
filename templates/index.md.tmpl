# {{ .ProviderShortName | lower }} provider

The provider offers a handy syntax to define Grafana dashboards: time series, gauge, bar gauge, stat, etc.

The provider defines only data sources. Each data source computes a JSON that is compatible with Grafana API.
Therefore, this provider is not particularly useful on its own, but it can be
used to generate a JSON compatible with Grafana API, which can then be used
with [Grafana provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/grafana/grafana/latest/docs) to provision a dashboard.

You can start using data sources without defining `provider "gdashboard"`,
unless you would like to configure provider-wise defaults for a certain panels (see an example below).

## Dashboard Provisioning Example

As mentioned above, the provider is not helpful since its only output is JSON.
But you can provision a dashboard using [Grafana provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/grafana/grafana/latest/docs).

## Defaults Example

You can define **defaults** for a data source. That means the provider takes a default value from the provider configuration
when an attribute is missing in your data source definition.

For example, we can configure the provider to use a custom legend with **all** timeseries panels.
Don't worry, you can always override an attribute.
